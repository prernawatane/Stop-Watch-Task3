<h1>Stop Watch</h1> 



- **Time** is the most essential part of everyone's life and keeping track of this time is equally important.
  <br>
- A **clock** helps us in our quest to utilize our time efficiently. To assist you to excel in this quest we are building a digital stopwatch.
  <br>
- This **stopwatch** represents the time in **DD:HH:MM: SS** ```(day:hour:minute: second)``` format, making it easy to keep track of our time.
  <br>
- The functionalities of **Start, Stop, Reset, Lap, and Clear Lap** are accessible with a click of a button.
  <br>
- To enhance the visual appearance it can be viewed in **both dark and light modes,** making it easier to access at all times, along with having a responsive website to maximize the user experience.
